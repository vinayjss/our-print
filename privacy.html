        <p>
          Some laws require us to explain our lawful reason for processing your
          personal information. We process personal information about you on the
          basis that it is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            necessary for the performance of a contract: where we have a
            contract with you, we will process your personal information in

          </li>
          <li>
            in our or a third parties’ legitimate interests: details of those
            legitimate interests are set out in more detail below (e.g.,
            provision of Services that we are contractually obliged by a third
            party, such as your employer or our subscriber, to deliver to you)
          </li>
          <li>
            where you give us your consent: we only ask for your consent in
            relation to specific uses of personal information where we need to
            and, if we need it, we will collect it separately and make it clear
            that we are asking for consent
          </li>
          <li>
            for compliance with a legal obligation (e.g., to respond to a court
            order or a regulator)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are welcome to contact us for further information on the legal
          grounds that we rely on in relation to any specific processing of your
          personal information.
        </p>
        <p>4. Legitimate interests for use</p>

            To deliver and suggest tailored content such as news, research,

            Services more user-friendly

            sometimes share your personal information across our Services so
            that we can make all of the Services we deliver to you more
            intuitive (e.g., rather than requiring you to enter the same data

            subscriber provides for your access to our Services, to meet their

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where we rely on legitimate interests as a lawful ground for
          processing your personal information, we balance those interests
          against your interests, fundamental rights and freedom. For more
          information on how this balancing exercise has been carried out,
          please contact us.
        </p>
        <h4>Marketing</h4>
        <p>
          We deliver marketing and event communications to you across various
          platforms such as e- mail, telephone, text messaging, direct mail and
          online. Where required by law, we will ask you to explicitly opt in to
          receive marketing from us. If we send you a marketing communication it
          wi
        </p>
        <p>
          Honouring your marketing preferences is important to us. You have the
          right to opt out of receiving emails or call or text messages of
          targeted marketing
        </p>
        <h4>How to opt out of email marketing</h4>
        <p>
          Where we send marketing emails, we provide unsubscribe options for
          your use within our emails. In addition, you can also use the “Contact
          Us” feature of a particular Service, discuss with ourprint.in contact
          or contact our Privacy Team. Even if you opt out of receiving
          marketing communications by email, we may still send you service
          communications or important transactional information related to your
          accounts and subscriptions (for purposes such as providing customer
          support).
        </p>
        <h4>Interest-based advertising (IBA)</h4>
        <p>
          Interest-based advertising (IBA) allows us to deliver targeted
          advertising to users of our Services. IBA works by showing you
          advertisements, or sending you marketing emails, that are based on the
          type of content you access or read. For example, as you browse our
          Services, one of the cookies placed on your device will be an
          advertising cookie so we can better understand what sort of pages or
          content you are interested in. The information collected about your
          device enables us to group you with other devices that have shown
          similar interests. We can then display advertising to categories of
          users that is based on common interests.
        </p>
        <h4>Opting out of IBA</h4>
        <p>
          If you want to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, it
          does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are
          using our Services. It just means that we will not use your personal
          information for IBA and that any advertising you see will not be
          customized to you. You can opt out of receiving interest-based ads
          from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) Opt
          Out Tool and in the EU. If you delete cookies, use a different device,
          or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again.
        </p>
        <h4>Advertising on mobile devices</h4>
        <p>
          Mobile devices have an identifier that gives companies the ability to
          serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device. In many cases, you can
          turn off mobile device ad tracking or you can reset the advertising
          identifier at any time within your mobile device privacy settings.
          Another tool you can use to control advertising on your mobile device
          is the AppChoices App. You may also choose to turn off location
          tracking on your mobile device. If you turn off ad tracking or
          location tracking, we will no longer use information collected from
          yourdevice’s advertising identifier for the purposes of advertising.
          You may still see the same number of ads but they may be less relevant
          because they will not be based on your interests. Where we need your
          consent to gather information about your location we will obtain this
          from you.
        </p>
        <h4>Use of cookies:</h4>
        <p>
          Ourprint.in and our third-party providers set and use cookies and
          similar technologies to store and manage user preferences, deliver
          targeted advertising, enable content, and gather analytic and usage
          data, for example. The use of cookies and other tracking technologies
          is standard across websites and apps through which information is
          collected about your online activities across applications, websites,
          or other services. More information about how we use cookies and
          similar technologies and how you can control and manage them is below.
        </p>
        <h4>What is a cookie?</h4>
        <p>
          A cookie is a small text file that is placed on a computer or other
          device and is used to identify the user or device and to collect
          information. Cookies are typically assigned to one of four categories,
          depending on their function and intended purpose: absolutely necessary
          cookies, performance cookies, functional cookies, and cookies for
          marketing purposes.
        </p>

            images) that we use to help deliver cookies on our sites, count
            users who have visited those sites, deliver Services, and analyse
            the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, for example. We may
            also include web beacons in our marketing email messages or
            newsletters to determine whether an email is opened or if links are
            clicked. Web beacons are also used to deliver you interest-based
            advertising.
          </li>
          <li>
            Web server & application logs: Our servers automatically collect

        <h4>“Do not track” signals</h4>
        <p>
          Some browsers transmit Do Not Track (DNT) signals to websites. Due to
          the lack of a common interpretation of DNT signals throughout the
          industry, we do not currently alter, change, or respond to DNT
          requests or signals from these browsers. We continue to monitor
          industry activity in this area and reassess our DNT practices as
          necessary.
